## TODO

Tasks for this project include:
- We need to give credit for the card images &mdash; and we need a joker card image & card back image.
- Randomizing images &mdash; in pairs &mdash; and adding them to each button.
- Managing user unput for things like the number of cards.
- Create a dictionary of filenames mapped to `Image`s using [`os.walk`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk).
- *So much more!*
